# Adaptive Steganography Engine v2.0.0 Prototype

This repository hosts the Adaptive Steganography Engine v2.0.0 demo implementation. The solution
combines advanced image forensics, cryptography, and a PyQt6 desktop interface to embed and extract
UTF-8 payloads inside 24-bit PNG images using adaptive multi-bit LSB techniques.

Refer to [`adaptive_stego_engine/README.md`](adaptive_stego_engine/README.md) for complete
architecture, setup, and usage instructions.
